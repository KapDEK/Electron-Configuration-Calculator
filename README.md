# Electron-Configuration-Calculator
Welcome to the Electron Configuration Calculator, an interactive web application designed to simplify the world of chemistry, specifically focusing on electron configurations and related calculations. This Flask-powered tool offers a user-friendly interface for both students and educators in chemistry, providing quick and accurate insights into the electron arrangements of elements.

Features
Electron Configuration Calculation: Input an element's atomic number or symbol to receive its electron configuration.
Valence Electron Determination: Automatically calculates the number of valence electrons for the given element.
Sublevel Electron Capacity: Find out the maximum number of electrons that can reside in a specified sublevel (e.g., 2p, 3d).
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use forms for inputting atomic numbers or symbols, and instantly viewable results.
Responsive Design: Accessible on various devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.
How It Works
The application adheres to the Aufbau principle, Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule to determine the electron configuration of elements. By entering either the atomic number or the symbol of an element, users can obtain detailed information about its electronic arrangement.
